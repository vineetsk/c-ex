For demo purpose only.

Most of the times we get examples on C which demo certain aspects or features of the C language using printf statement.
This means, if one wants to try out things with these examples on the machine, she has to always verify the result of 
her modification by looking at the result presented on the screen.

This becomes ugly when example becomes complex. One can not modify example immediately and verify if nothing is broken.
The automated unit test frame work will give this opportunity to do so. Thus a learner will also get an opportunity to 
implement it in different manner and still with one command will be able to verify that nothing is broken.

Thus it is more a TDD philosophy applied to examples.
